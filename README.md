## Usage
First decide how many of the weights you want to use and how you want to serve the fonts. At ChangeTip, we use all 6 weights and the Base64-encoded .woff files in our SCSS. I won't attempt to put together ready-to-use stylesheets for everyone because I'd probably get it wrong. :) Everything you should need will be in the ```/fonts/``` directory.
